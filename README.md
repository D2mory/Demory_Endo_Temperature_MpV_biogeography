# Demory_Endo_Temperature_MpV_biogeography
 This repository contains scripts to reproduce figures and analyses for our study on Temperature-driven biogeography of marine giant viruses infecting picoeukaryotes Micromonas

# FOR HISASHI:
- add figure 2a script in /src
- add figure 2c script directly in the jupyter notebook at the correct section in ./src/figure2_mpv_groups_temperature_distribution_17102024.ipynb
